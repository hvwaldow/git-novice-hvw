Version control is better than mailing files back and forth:

- Nothing that is committed to version control is ever lost, unless
  you work really, really hard at losing it. Since all old versions of
  files are saved, it's always possible to go back in time to see
  exactly who wrote what on a particular day, or what version of a
  program was used to generate a particular set of results.

- As we have this record of who made what changes when, we know who to ask
  if we have questions later on, and, if needed, revert to a previous
  version, much like the "undo" feature in an editor.

- When several people collaborate in the same project, it's possible to
  accidentally overlook or overwrite someone's changes. The version control
  system automatically notifies users whenever there's a conflict between one
  person's work and another's.

Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone
researchers can benefit immensely.  Keeping a record of what was
changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they
ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later,
when memory has faded).

## Prerequisites

In this lesson we use Git from the Unix Shell.
Some previous experience with the shell is expected,
*but isn't mandatory*.
